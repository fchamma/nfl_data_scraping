### Analyzing NFL play by play data

In this project we will investigate NFL play by play data and try to discover interesting patterns, creating engaging statistical visualizations.

To do that, we gathered data from every play since 1998 season until 2014, as well as other information regarding the teams and the players. We got data from the following websites:

www.nfl.com
www.pro-football-reference.com

Our goal is to connect the game result with the game plays, which brings relevant insight on winning teams characteristics.
